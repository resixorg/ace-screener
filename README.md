# ACE Screener

## Introduction
**The ACE Screener by the Resix Organization is a web-based application that allows for a simple, convenient and anonymous questionnaire-based screening of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) in adults and young adults.**

## About Resix
The Resix Organisation (www.resix.org) is a non-profit foundation developing open source software for resilience, self-empowerment, peer-based support, mental health, and societal development. 

The Resix Organisation also works to build and release IT-mediated tools and interventions as _open content_, thereby supporting and stimulating the democratization of such tools and interventions. 

## About the ACE Study
The ACE Study scientifically proved the link between childhood trauma and long-term health and social consequences and is one of the most important scientific studies in recent times (http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html).

## Value Proposition
The value proposition and functionality that the ACE Screener provides is explained through the Stanford Research Institute NABC model (Need, Approach, Benefit, Cost) (however omitting the "Cost").

### Need
Being able to screen people for ACEs in an easy and convenient way is important as the results of such screenings can help people live better lives through informed follow-up actions.

### Approach
The ACE Screener provides an interactive web-application that allows for the easy and anonymous screening of ACEs across smartphones, tablets, and web-browsers using scientifically-validated questionnaires.

### Benefit
The ACE Screener provides:
- the individual with a simple and convenient tool for screening him/herself (and saving the results for later use). 
- therapists, teachers, and other professionals with the tools needed to screen multiple people in a single session and have the results presented in easy-to-read reports.
- organizations the means to easily embed an ACE screener into their own intranets, websites, and web-based tools, thus making able a context-relevant screening for ACEs without having to implement a screener themselves.

## Anonymity
The ACE Screener is developed on a principle of _most anonymity first_, and it does not rely on transmitting and saving data on a server to work.

In its default configuration, the ACE Screener ensures maximum anonymity for the person being screened. It does so by confining all the information entered by the user (as well as all the computations performed on the information) within the user's browser, without sending it across the internet _unless_ the user wishes to send the data back to some backend server.

## User Experience and Functionality
The following is some of the user experience (UX) and functionality that the ACE Screener is expected to present in its first stable release (subject to change as the project evolves):
* An intuitive, simple, lean and coherent user experience 
* Cross-device and cross-browser support
* Most anonymity first
* The ability to:
  * Save screening outcomes locally
  * Present screening outcomes as report PDFs
  * Be embeddable
  * Support multiple languages (with initial focus on English, Spanish, Russian, French, and German)

## Roadmap
The roadmap for the ACE Screener is as follows:

| Version | When | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 0.1     | November | An alpha-version with limited functionality and with the purpose of providing a proof-of-concept (PoC) of select features of the screener to stakeholders |
| 0.2     | November | A beta version with more functionality (and fewer errors) |
| 1.0     | November/December |The first stable version to be used in production use |

_All dates are 2015 dates._
