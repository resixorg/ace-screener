# The ACE Toolkit

## Introduction
**The ACE Toolkit by the Resix Organization is an ambitious suite of technology-mediated tools and services that have the collective goal of enabling individuals and therapists alike to screen for, alleviate the effects of, and, to the widest extent possible, aid the prevention of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) across people of all ages.**

## About Resix
The Resix Organisation (www.resix.org) is a non-profit foundation developing open source software for resilience, self-empowerment, peer-based support, mental health, and societal development. 

The Resix Organisation also works to build and release IT-mediated tools and interventions as _open content_, thereby supporting and stimulating the democratization of such tools and the psychological interventions contained herein. 

## About the ACE Study
The ACE Study scientifically proved the link between childhood trauma and long-term health and social consequences and is one of the most important scientific studies in recent times (http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/acestudy/index.html).

The contents of the ACE Toolkit is under active development.

## [ACE Screener](https://github.com/resixorg/ace-toolkit/wiki/ACE-Screener)
The first product released will be a screening tool for ACEs to be used by individuals and therapist alike. We find that there is a lack of simple and easy-to-use screening tools that allow for easy embedding in therapist and community websites, and which by default preserve the privacy of the people being screened.
